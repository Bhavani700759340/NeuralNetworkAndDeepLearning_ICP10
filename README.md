In this lesson, we discused types of ANNs and Recurrent Neural Network.
Use Case Description:
1. Sentiment Analysis on the Twitter dataset
Programming elements:
1. Basics of LSTM
2. Types of RNN
3. Use case: Sentiment Analysis on the Twitter data set
In class programming:
1. Saved the model and usde the saved model to predict on new text data (ex, “A lot of good things are
happening. We are respected again throughout the world, and that's a great thing .@realDonaldTrump”)
2. Applied GridSearchCV on the source code provided in the class
